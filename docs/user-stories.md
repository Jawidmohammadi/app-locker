1.  As a household member who shares a tablet with other family members.I want my personal apps to be locked even though a member of my family is using my tablet.
2.  As a mother of a child, I want my phone and the data inside the phone to be safe and secure when i hand-over my phone to my child to play with it.
  he/she should not mess around by being on his/her monkey mode with the other sensitive data and applications on my phone,
  or to accidently open the phone-book and call some one.
   so i expect by using this application, my data to be safe.
3.   As a young adult, i want to have privacy with my apps and messages.
   so whenever my bf/gf want to use my phone cant go through my messages.
   and when my parents want to have my phone for a specific reason could not go to other social apps and messages.
   
4.    As an old person, i expect to have every information that i daily use like credit card, bank account, passwords, that i can't memorize it , i want to have a place to have the stored as notes.
    and those notes be safe and secure and be available only by using fingerprint authentication.
