1.  As a household member who shares a tablet with other family members, I want my personal apps to be locked when member of my family is using my tablet.
2.  As a mother of a child, I want my phone and the data inside the phone to be safe and secure when i hand-over my phone to my child to play with it.
  so He/She wouldn't be able to mess around with my other apps,
  or to accidently open the phone-book and call some numbers.
   so i expect by using this app to get the apps and other data to be safe and secure.
3.   As a young adult, i want to have privacy on my apps and messages.
   so whenever my bf/gf want to use my phone, They should'nt be able to through my messages.
   
4.    As an old person, i expect to have every information that i daily use like credit card, bank account, passwords, that i can't memorize it , i want to have a place to have them stored as a note.
    and those notes to be safe and secure and be available only by using my PIN or Password.
